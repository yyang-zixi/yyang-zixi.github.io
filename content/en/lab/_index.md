Our research is guided by a single vision: to use quantitative intelligence to improve human health and economic well-being.

At HealthQuant Lab, we integrate methods from health economics, industrial organization, and machine learning (ML) to understand how healthcare markets function, why health disparities persist, and how data-driven policies can promote fairness and efficiency.

Our research agenda is built on three interconnected pillars:

- Health Economics Analytics – applying econometric and modern data-science methods to evaluate how healthcare markets, innovations, and policies shape efficiency, equity, and population well-being.

- Evidence-Based Equity – uncovering and quantifying structural inequities through data-driven policy evaluation to advance fairness and evidence-based decision-making.

- Human-Centered Machine Learning – designing interpretable algorithms that prioritize social utility and public value over purely technical performance.

Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to transform how researchers, clinicians, and policymakers use data to build more equitable and efficient health systems.

We are always looking for motivated students and collaborators who share our mission.

Summer and Winter Research Assistant positions are available. Feel free to contact us if you are interested in joining the HealthQuant Lab.
